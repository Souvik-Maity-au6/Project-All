# Image Uploader

    It’s basically a hub where you
    can pretty much upload photos and talk about memes and stuff.

# Features

    1. Authentication
    2. Image upload feature for auth users, with description and title, with
    privacy status (Just like we saw on Youtube Data API while creating
    playlists).
    3. Visiting the images (which have a privacy status of “public”) of what
    others have posted.
    4. Add posts to favorites (both on backend as well as frontend), and be
    able to visit them whenever needed on a separate page. (For auth users
    only).
